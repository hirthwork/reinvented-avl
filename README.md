Disclaimer
----------
This is not a production ready solution! This code was implemented because I
have found pure C AVL tree implementation challenging a bit. There are no
functions for node deletion or iteration or even for tree cloning.
Although tests provides 100% lines and branches coverage, I can't guarantee
that this code works correct. Use at your own risk.

Overview
--------
Simple AVL tree implementation. Provides find and insert methods. See avl.h
comments for details. All usage examples can be found in test.c
